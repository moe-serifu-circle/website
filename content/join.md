Interested in joining Moe Serifu Circle? We are looking for volunteers to
become contributors to the project! All levels of skill are accepted.

If you would like to help out, join the crew's [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MoeSerifuCircle),
or sign up at our [Google form](https://goo.gl/forms/64xkgwX9hYDz18CX2).

The general time commitment is attending a meeting once every two weeks. If
you are in the area, physical presence is preferred, but if you can't make it,
that's alright! You can join the meetings online as well.

We need help with the following areas:

* **Programming** - The project is currently primarily written in C++, but this may
change as we expand into different libraries for visualization.
* **Art** - We need art both for promotion of the project, as well as the actual
system itself. Masa-chan needs artists to help bring her to life!
* **Administration** - Moe Serifu Circle is in the process of becoming a Non-Profit
organization, and we need members who can sit on the board of directors and help
guide the overall operations of the group.
* **Social Media** - We maintain a presence on Facebook as the circle itself,
and we're on Twitter as [Masa-chan](https://www.twitter.com/MoeSerifu). We can
always use more help making it fun and engaging for the general public.

Thank you for your interest!
