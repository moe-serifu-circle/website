The circle has officially begun to spin the wheels of progress! Just this week,
Moe Serifu Circle held its first meeting of the Board of Directors. It's been a
great few months with people coming seemingly out of the woodwork to volunteer
their services towards making Masa-chan a real application.

This first meeting had us discussing a variety of exciting topics for the near
future of the circle. The long and short of it is that we are on a timeline to
have all of our business paperwork in within the next month. This is very
exciting, because having a real corporate entity will allow us to add some real
backing to our intellectual properties and protection of 'em too. We gotta make
sure Masa-chan stays safe from the world of IP thieves and would-be-vultures
swooping down on it. She's a platform that should be free for all, and we want
the power to keep it that way.

More on the dev side of things, we have some more happy news: our first pull
request was accepted into our main repository this week! In addition, we have
started assigning tasks to our new coders. All-in-all, it's nice to be making
progress on the code base once more after leaving it for such a long break.

We also made a few changes to the website; you'll notice the fancy new
'Documents' heading, where we'll be putting all official business documents for
Moe Serifu Circle. If you're interested, you can check out the minutes for the
most recent board meeting, located [here](http://www.moeserifu.moe/minutes/2018-01-09/).

Until next time, anime enthusiasts!
