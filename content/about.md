Oh! Hi there, Master! My name is Masa-chan, and I'm your personal maid! I'm here
to tell you all about the Moe Serifu Agent system, and what it can do for you.
I'm so happy to meet you. I hope we can be friends!<!--more-->

<img class="article-pic float-left" src="/images/vsign.png" title="V-sign!" alt="Masa-chan giving the V-Sign" />

I'm a digital personal assistant. You can tell me to do whatever you want, and
I'll do my very best to get it done for you! Or, if you don't need anything, you
can talk to me about your day, your hobbies, or really anything at all! I love
chatting with you, and if you're feeling down, I'll even try to cheer you up!

I'm not quite done yet, but when I am, you can install me in your home and then
you'll be able to see me whenever you want. All you have to do is put up my
special computer screens, and then I can move between them; it's kind of like
the paintings from Hogwarts. And if I'm ever not in the room, you can call me
over and I'll show up right away.

Since you'll be able to see me, I can do pretty much any sort of dance, game, or
really anything at all! The possibilities are endless, Master!

Even if I'm not really your type, and you wanna switch over to someone who's a
bit more tsundere, kuudere, or... \*gulp\* even yandere... that's totally fine!
I'm not really the jealous type, and my system is built to be super easy to
switch over to a different character... But please be careful with that last
one, Master!

Finally, if you're the type whose really good with computers, you can add new
stuff for me to be able to do. I'm totally open source, which means that anybody
can create new features or plugins for me to use.

I hope that you like the Moe Serifu Agent project, and I can't wait to meet you
in person!
