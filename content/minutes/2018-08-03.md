## Minutes
### New Board Member, Abby Sussman
Officially announced Abby joining the board of directors.

### Bylaws Discussion
Covered term limits, decided on keeping bylaws as drafted. Discussed putting
structure of general meetings in bylaws, decided against based on the fact that
bylaws should be difficult to change, and the structure of meetings, while they
might be formalized, would not be a good fit for the bylaws.

consisting of the following members:

* Rebecca Nelson, President
* Nathan Spanier, Treasurer
* Abby Sussman, Director
* Jack Hedlund-Fay, Director

* Nathan S: Aye
* Abby S: Aye
* Jack H: Aye
